Project Overview

This project is a simple Supermarket Management System designed to provide users and administrators with convenient management and operation capabilities. The system includes features such as user login, password modification, session handling, and order management (viewing and editing). It is developed using Java and uses MySQL as the backend database.

Handles database operations via JDBC.
5. Order Management
Displays order information, including order ID, user details, and total amount.
Supports administrators in editing order details (e.g., status and amount).
